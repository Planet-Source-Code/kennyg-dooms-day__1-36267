Here is a missle command type game i wrote in gwbasic then later
ported to vb6. It's a blast to play and the code may have some educational 
value. It is a fairly simple and neatly written piece of code using
linked lists to track screen activity.  It has increasingly difficult
levels, up to the point of impossible. Levels are fully configurable
by the user (# of bombs, smart bombs, missles, speed, etc.) Have fun!
